# Overview

ovmh (ov_makehuman) is a MakeHuman extension for Nvidia Omniverse. This project relies on the makehuman project from https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman. 

# Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is using Omniverse Create. Navigate to the Extensions window and click on "Community".  Search for `makehuman` and you should see our extension show up.  

The extension may take a few minutes to install as it will download makehuman and install it in the Omniverse's local Python instance.
